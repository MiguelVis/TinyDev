Overview
--------

TinyDev is a programming language for kids. It was created with the goal they learn how to resolve logical problems.

Although it's a very complete language, it has been designed to be easy using it, avoiding the complications and difficulties of certain programming languages for kids, very much in vogue today.

Using TinyDev, the kids can draw graphics, write text, move images on screen, play sounds, and interact with their programs with the keyboard and the mouse.

In addition, it's accompanied by a small IDE (Integrated Development Environment). With it, the kids can create, edit and run their own programs, as with professional programming languages.

And... it's free!
